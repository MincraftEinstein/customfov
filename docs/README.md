# Custom FoV 

Custom FoV is a mod that allows players to customize various field of view settings through the configuration file.
The current settings allow configuration for flying, aiming, underwater and speed-related field of view changes.
The speed-related field of view changes can further be broken down into sprinting and potion effect-related changes.

This mod is **client-side only**.
